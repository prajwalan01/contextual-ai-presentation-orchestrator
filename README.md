# Smart Resume Search API

A **FastAPI-based application** to upload, parse, and query resumes in PDF format.  
Supports single and multi-keyword searches and returns structured JSON highlighting **Skills**, **Experience**, and **Projects**. Optional support for non-resume PDFs is also included.

---

## Key Features

- Upload multiple PDF resumes at once.
- Automatically clears previous uploads on each new upload to ensure only current PDFs are searchable.
- Single and multi-keyword search across all uploaded PDFs.
- Lists uploaded PDFs.

PDF Ingestion: Upload and parse PDFs, extract text. Previous uploads are cleared automatically.

Embedding Generation: Convert text chunks into vector embeddings.

Vector Database (FAISS): Store embeddings for fast similarity search.

Query Interface: Accept keyword queries, return structured JSON results.

Performance & Limitations
FAISS vector search ensures fast keyword lookups, even with dozens of PDFs.

Handles PDFs with non-standard formats, but extremely large PDFs may take longer to process.

Designed for local infrastructure and free/open-source tools.

Previous uploads are automatically cleared on new uploads to prevent old PDFs from appearing in search results.
