# Smart Resume Search API

A **FastAPI-based application** to upload, parse, and query resumes in PDF format.  
Supports single and multi-keyword searches and returns structured JSON highlighting **Skills**, **Experience**, and **Projects**. Optional support for non-resume PDFs is also included.

---

## Key Features

- Upload multiple PDF resumes at once.
- Automatically clears previous uploads on each new upload to ensure only current PDFs are searchable.
- Single and multi-keyword search across all uploaded PDFs.
- Lists uploaded PDFs.

1. **PDF Ingestion:** Upload and parse PDFs, extract text. Previous uploads are cleared automatically.  
2. **Embedding Generation:** Convert text chunks into vector embeddings.  
3. **Vector Database (FAISS):** Store embeddings for fast similarity search.  
4. **Query Interface:** Accept keyword queries, return structured JSON results.

User Guide
Upload PDFs
Endpoint: POST /upload_pdfs

Description: Upload one or multiple PDF resumes. Previous uploads are cleared automatically.

Request Example (cURL):

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload_pdfs" \
  -F "files=@Resume1.pdf" \
  -F "files=@Resume2.pdf"
Response Example:

json
Copy code
{
  "status": "uploaded",
  "files": ["Resume1.pdf", "Resume2.pdf"]
}
Single Keyword Search
Endpoint: POST /query_resume

Description: Search for a single keyword across all uploaded PDFs.

Request Example:

json
Copy code
{
  "keyword": "Python"
}
Response Example:

json
Copy code
{
  "Resume1.pdf": {
    "Skills": ["Python"],
    "Experience": [],
    "Projects": []
  }
}
Multi-Keyword Search
Endpoint: POST /multi_search

Description: Search using multiple keywords across all uploaded PDFs.

Request Example:

json
Copy code
{
  "keywords": ["Python", "React"]
}
Response Example:

json
Copy code
{
  "Resume1.pdf": {
    "Skills": ["Python", "React"],
    "Experience": [],
    "Projects": []
  }
}
List Uploaded PDFs
Endpoint: GET /list_files

Description: List all PDFs currently uploaded to the system.

Response Example:

json
Copy code
{
  "uploaded_files": ["Resume1.pdf", "Resume2.pdf"]
}
Performance & Limitations
FAISS vector search ensures fast keyword lookups, even with dozens of PDFs.

Handles PDFs with non-standard formats, but extremely large PDFs may take longer to process.

Designed for local infrastructure and free/open-source tools.

Previous uploads are automatically cleared on new uploads to prevent old PDFs from appearing in search results.
